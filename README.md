# Work Log Database

## Overview

The Work Log Database is Project 4 of Team Treehouse's Python Web Development Techdegree.

The assignment was to create a command line application to record work tasks and time spent. It uses sqlite as the database and Peewee as the ORM. User stories were provided to build out the features.

## Requirements

Work Log Database requires sqlite and peewee. It is written in python 3.7.3.

- Install sqlite from their [downloads](https://sqlite.org/download.html) page.
- You can install peewee from the command line with `pip3 install peewee`

## Usage

- clone the repo to your computer
- run the program from the root of the repo folder with `python3 app.py`
- If you have linux or mac, you can run `chmod +x app.py` to make the program executable, then run it with `./app.py`

## What I learned

- Continued work with User Stories to build application functionality
- Sqlite3
- PeeWee ORM
- Building database models
- CRUD
